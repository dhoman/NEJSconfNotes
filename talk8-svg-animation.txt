why svg?
	resolution independent
	lightweight
	styleable
	interactive
	accessible

why animate?
	create fluid transitions
	provide visual feedback
	guide the user
	create an emotional response

the goal of animating a function is to transitioning things like
in a real world. in the real world things dont just abruptly
change, ice cube just doesn't instantly become a puddle, it's a
gradual change. without the transition context is lost

animations can guide a user's intentions, and let people know
whats next, and can illict an emotional response

why snap?
