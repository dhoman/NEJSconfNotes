a map of NYC
	john randel, jr. dude who made the map of NYC

became one of the three NYC st commissioners

in late 18th century
manhatten 125k, most of the population lived in the SW tip
	most of island was sprawled with private estates
	not overlapping but two cities on the same island

1807 comission of streets and roads
	appointed John randel, jr. was chief engineer and surveyor

4 years, to produce 3 maps (9ft ) maps of the intersections of
the island

magic to mapmaking

provide bouundary and scope
"to put a city ina  book, to put the world on one sheet of
paper- maps are the most condensed humanized spaces of all" -
robert something and another

research -> design -> deelop -> launch

we are basically on a daily basis making a map of the web.

and most of the time we are developing our maps for one device
and then mobile broke our maps. by changing how we access the
web

responsive web design
about embracing the flexibility of the web by leveraging it to
allow us to design

RWD isnt' the answer to every problem cause it's not

editorially

really only 3 ingredients to any RWD
fluid grids
flexible images
media queries

fluid grid
	target % grid = result

learning to love :nth child()
	3 grid
	:nth-child(3n) right most column
	:nth-child(3n+1) left most column

media queries
	for major and minor adjustments

baseline
breakpoints at width to make it two column layout
media screen and (min-width: 80em)

we can create a design that doesn't nessarily have one best
viewed on whatever design

designing a network a network of small layout systems
loosely bound to other elements around them

the mast
	sort tasks into logical groups
	
breakpoints are defined by the needs of the content / layout
system
	don't focus on the devices or screen sizes

content out
	can't keep up with the number of devices out there
	so we need to focus on designing around the content as
	opposed to the devices

i think you have to face the music - responsive design makes it
very hard to write a fast website.

	rheotrical divide
	language is never going to be able to fully describe
	something

	the map is not the territory
	you are looking at an abstraction
	something is going to get left out

	the more accure the map, the more it resembles the
	territory. the most accurate map possible would be the
	territory......???

dhaka is classified as a megacity
15.4m inhabitants
134 square miles

900% more internet users in 2011

africa 60% mobile penetration

7 billion mobile subs in 2013
60% sub 3g networks

9bill est in 2017
36% will be on edge

a new normal
these regions are the new types of users that we are going to be
seeing in the worldwide state of users accessing the web

back to NYC analogy
randal had to plan for balance of the private estates (the
privilaged) and the future growth (the populated SW corner of
NYC)

he was planning for a better version fo NYC that didn't exist at
the time

??? ... to promote the health of the city.

how can we promote the health of the web?

lets begin a cnversation about sustainability in web design

reduce and revisit

reduce
we noticed a sharp decline in conversation rate as avg site load
times increases from 1 to 4 seconds

clearleft.com/thinks/responsivedesignonabudget/

our pages should weight no more than 300kb
should take no more than 3secs to load over a sub 3g connection

revisit
the old idea of progressive enhancement
bbc site
 basic and enhanced version

 cutting the mustard
 browser check and add js loaders for the enhancements
 otherwise just show the basic experience

 we don't have any non-JS users
 no all yoru users are nonjs while they're downloading your JS

 rolling up the map

 what works is better than what looks good. the 'looks good' can
 change, but what works, works

 a new definition of "beautiful"
